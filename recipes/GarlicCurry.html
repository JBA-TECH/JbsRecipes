    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Fry Garlic &amp; Onions: Heat oil/ghee in a large pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and fry until light golden brown. (Optional: Remove half the garlic and set aside for garnish). Add diced onions and fry until golden brown (6–8 minutes).</li>
        <li>Bloom the Aromatics: Add the ginger and any remaining garlic; sauté for 1 minute. Stir in the turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili powder. Cook for 30–60 seconds, adding a splash of water if the spices start to stick.</li>
        <li>Build the Base: Stir in the tomatoes. Cook for about 5 minutes until they break down and the oil begins to separate from the sauce.</li>
        <li>Brown the Chicken: Add the chicken pieces. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the chicken is browned on all sides and coated in the spice base.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Pour in the stock or water. Bring to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook for 15–20 minutes until the chicken is tender.</li>
        <li>The Finish: Stir in the garam masala, fenugreek leaves, and optional cream. Simmer uncovered for 2 minutes to thicken. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Optional:Squeeze of lemon</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Garlic Texture: Use a mix of sliced garlic for texture and crushed garlic to melt into the sauce.</li>
        <li>Consistency: If the sauce is too thin, simmer uncovered for the last 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serving: Best enjoyed with fluffy basmati rice or buttery naan bread.</li>
        <li>Hotness: Remove the green chilli seeds or replace with green peppers reduce the chilli amount </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How did the evening go?</h2>
    <ul>
    <p>We enjoyed the meal very much we served it with Basmati rice and toasted nan bread with butter.
        For 
        a starter we had poppadoms and onion salad. For next time I will reduce the hotness for my other half and need to try and find a way to get some tastier poppadoms together than you buy at the supermarket.
