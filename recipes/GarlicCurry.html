===========================
<p>Ingredients</p>
<ul>
    <li>Chicken: 500g–600g boneless, skinless chicken thighs (cut into bite-sized pieces).</li>
    <br>
    <li>Garlic: 10-15 cloves (about 1 whole bulb), thinly sliced or crushed.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Ginger: 1-inch piece, finely grated or pasted.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Onion: 1 large, finely diced.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Oil/Ghee: 3-4 tbsp.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Spices: 1 tsp turmeric powder, 1 tsp cumin powder, 1 tbsp coriander powder, 1-2 tsp chilli powder (or to taste), 1 tsp garam masala.</li>
    <br>    
    <li>Tomatoes: 1 can (400g) chopped tomatoes or 300g blended fresh tomatoes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Liquid: 100-200ml chicken stock or water</li>
    <br>
    <li>Finishers: 1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi - highly recommended), fresh cilantro (coriander), 1-2 green chillies (optional)</li>
    <br>
    <li>Salt: To taste. </li>
   
</ul>

<p>Instructions </p>
<ol>
<li>Prep the Chicken: Toss the chicken pieces with 1/2 tsp turmeric, salt, and 1 tsp of the garlic paste (if using) and set aside.<li></li>
<br>
<li>Fry Garlic & Onions: Heat oil/ghee in a large pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and fry until light golden brown (do not burn). Remove half the garlic for garnish. Add diced onions to the pan and fry until golden brown, about 6-8 minutes.</li>
<br>
<li>Add Aromatics & Spices: Add the ginger and remaining garlic (if not already fried) and sauté for 1 minute. Stir in the cumin, coriander, chilli powder, and remaining turmeric. Cook for 30-60 seconds, adding a splash of water to prevent burning.</li>
<br>
<li>Cook Tomatoes & Chicken: Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes until they break down and the oil separates. Add the chicken and cook for 5 minutes until browned.</li>

<p>Tips For Success </p>
<ul>
<li>Garlic Prep: For a more intense flavor, use a mix of sliced garlic (for texture) and paste (for sauce density).</li>
<br>
<li>Fast Thickening: If the sauce is too thin, simmer uncovered for the last 5-10 minutes.</li>
<br>
<li>Takeaway Style: Add 1-2 tablespoons of tomato puree for a thicker, richer, red-colored sauce.</li>
<br>
<li>Pairing: Serve with basmati rice, naan, or roti. </li>
<br>
<li>Add Aromatics & Spices: Add the ginger and remaining garlic (if not already fried) and sauté for 1 minute. Stir in the cumin, coriander, chilli powder, and remaining turmeric. Cook for 30-60 seconds, adding a splash of water to prevent burning.</li>
