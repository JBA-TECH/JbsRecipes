<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol class="instructions">
    <li>Sear the Beef: Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker. Brown the beef cubes in batches to lock in flavor, then remove and set aside.</li>
    <li>Sauté Aromatics: In the same oil, add the whole spices. Once fragrant, add the onions and fry until golden brown. Stir in the ginger-garlic paste for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>The Masala Base: Add the chopped tomatoes and the powdered spices (except garam masala). Cook until the oil starts to separate from the mixture.</li>
    <li>Slow Simmer: Return the beef to the pot. Add enough water to cover the meat, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours (or 20 mins in a pressure cooker) until the beef is nearly tender.</li>
    <li>Add the Aloo: Toss in your potato cubes. Continue cooking for another 15–20 minutes until both the beef and potatoes are fork-tender.</li>
    <li>Finish: Stir in the garam masala and a handful of fresh cilantro (coriander).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul class="tips">
        <li>The Potato Trick: Fry the potato cubes separately in a little oil before adding them to the curry. This helps them hold their shape and adds a better texture.</li>
        <li>Consistency: If the gravy is too thin, mash one or two potato cubes into the sauce to thicken it naturally.</li>
